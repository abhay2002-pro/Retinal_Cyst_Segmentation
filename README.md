# Retinal Cyst Segmentation

This is the **Pytorch** implementation of our BTP.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pytorch >= 1.0
- gcc (tested with gcc 8)

Tested on *Ubuntu 20.04* with *pytorch 1.5*, *CUDA 10.2* and *gcc 8.0* .

## Installation

```console
git clone https://github.com/abhay2002-pro/Retinal_Cyst_Segmentation
cd Retinal_Cyst_Segmentation
bash install.sh
```

## Acknowledgments

We used the Pytorch implementation of correlation layer from "Pytorch implementation of FlowNet 2.0" [https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch).
